# GraClo
A Maple package for finding the independent components of a given tensor, and corresponding equations.

# Limitations
* There is no way to work explicitly with covariant and contravariant indices.
* It cannot work with components explicitly stated as functions as Maple seems to always try to solve for the independent variable, even when it is specified not to.
